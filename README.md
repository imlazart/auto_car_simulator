Auto Driving Car Simulation
============================

### Project Overview

The Auto Driving Car Simulation is a command-line program designed to simulate the movement of 
autonomous cars within a predefined rectangular field. The cars can move based on user-provided 
commands while following basic movement rules and avoiding boundary violations. The simulation 
detects collisions dynamically and stops affected cars, mimicking real-world driving constraints.

### Installation & Setup
